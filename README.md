<p> VLStereoSet: A Study of Stereotypical Bias in Pre-trained Vision-Language Models
</h3>


This repository contains an extensible codebase to measure stereotypical bias on new pretrained models, as well as code to replicate our results. We encourage the community to use this as a springboard for further evaluation of bias in pretrained language models, and to submit attempts to mitigate bias to the [leaderboard](http://stereoset.mit.edu).
